The Hunger Games,"Major themes of the novels include distrust of authority (of adults and the government), class discrimination and caste, resistance, the ethics of entertainment, and most notably, the origins and effects of war.[24] Social inequality, unaccountable governance and violence against children have also been suggested as prominent themes. ""In the world of the 'Hunger Games', the Capitol lives a life of extravagant wealth and consumption. Meanwhile, out in the 'districts', millions of people work dangerous jobs with low pay. As the Capitol wallows in excess, the districts can barely afford to feed their children.""[25] Author Suzanne Collins also mentions the themes of ""just war"", gladiatorial combat and hunger.[26] War as a result of climate disaster, and the power and illusions of television have also been cited as themes.[27] Others have mentioned revolution and rebellion as themes. ""Although it’s... aimed at young adults, it presents potentially quite subversive ideas of mass revolution, economic sabotage and the populist fight against oligarchy.""[28]"
Black Mirror,"As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each episode is standalone and can be watched in any order, although some episodes may contain references and easter eggs to previous episodes.[10] The programme is an instance of speculative fiction within science fiction: the majority of episodes are set in dystopian near-futures with novel technologies that exaggerate a trait from contemporary culture, often the internet.[11][12][13] An example is ""Crocodile"", where the Recaller device used to view a person's memories is the main difference from the modern world.[11] Many such technologies involve altering the human body or consciousness, with little in-universe concern for the morality of these actions.[12] They provide convenience or freedom to the user, but exacerbate problematic personality traits.[12][13] Adrian Martin of Screen wrote that many episodes depict ""basic human emotions and desires"" that ""intersect with, and get twisted by, a technological system that invariably spins out of control and into catastrophe"".[11] Retrofuturistic designs highlight the theme of each episode, often showing a lack of comfort, emotional connection or personalisation;[14] the settings are generally patriarchal and capitalist.[15] Recurring themes throughout Black Mirror include data privacy and surveillance, virtual reality, individualism and consumerism.[11][12] Many episodes have plot twists.[16][17]However, individual episodes explore varying genres.[11] Crime fiction episodes include the police procedurals ""Hated in the Nation"" and ""Smithereens"" and the Nordic noir ""Crocodile"".[18][19][20] Horror and psychological horror are features of ""Black Museum"" and ""Playtest"", respectively.[21][22] The first episode, ""The National Anthem"", contains black comedy and political satire.[23][24] Some episodes employ features of lighter-hearted genres, such as romance in ""San Junipero"" and ""Striking Vipers"", romantic comedy in ""Hang the DJ"", or space opera in ""USS Callister"".[25][26][27][28] Other genres include drama (""Fifteen Million Merits""), psychological thriller (Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), post-apocalyptic fiction (""Metalhead""), and war film (""Men Against Fire"").[11][15][29][30]Black Mirror can be seen to demonstrate a negative view of unending pursuit of scientific and technological advancement.[12] The majority of episodes end unhappily.[13] However, characters who carefully consider the risks of technology with which they engage are met with happy endings, as in ""San Junipero"".[12] Juliana Lopes of Via Panorâmica argued that the dystopian settings resemble the French Marxist Guy Debord's concept of the spectacle, wherein mass media create alienation and an unattainable utopia for individuals to pursue. For instance, in ""Nosedive"", the protagonist Lacie strives for a utopian life through superficiality and performativity, in a society where social media success contributes to high socioeconomic status.[13] Academics writing in Quarterly Review of Film and Video found that Black Mirror episodes fall into a genre of ""mind-game films"", wherein protagonists are disoriented and narratives are non-linear or fragmented. Films in this genre include Inception (2010) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and these works often show the unreliability of the state, technology or family.[12]"

Garland presents the conflict without clear political allegiances, emphasising the universal dangers of resorting to violence over dialogue and the fragility of democratic institutions.
